  "body": "### Synopsis \r\nThis project was started March 28th, 2016, with the ambitious goal of recreating one of the earlier Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games from scratch. \r\n\r\n### Implemented Features\r\n- Entity movement\r\n- Sprite rendering\r\n- State machine for animating and updating\r\n- Somewhat messy attack system, including HP and moves\r\n- Pathfinding - hand-made Djikstra's algorithm \r\n- Procedural Dungeon Generation\r\n- Floors and stairs\r\n\r\n### Graphics\r\nOriginally I used Java2D (Swing) to do rendering; now, I've switched to the popular graphics framework libGDX. Sprites are ripped from whatever online sources I could find them from; I do plan to eventually make my own. All rights go to their respective owners. \r\n\r\n### Progress\r\nI usually spend at least 15 minutes a day working on this project; and I've spent basically the last 8 months working on this. I expect to have a usable release within the next few years at my current pace, but hopefully I will drastically improve by then. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nI am the only person on this project so far. If you want to join, send me a message. \r\n",
