Have to simplify entity more so that it can be applied to items.
Inheritance tree like


Entity

DynamicEntity Static Entity
Pokemon         Items
PMob PPlayer    Berry

Each entity has two objects to be updated - one that corresponds to its current action state and updates animations and the other updates based on its action state
Must be a master controller that each object reinstantiates - checks for input
