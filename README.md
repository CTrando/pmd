# Pokemon Mystery Dungeon
To recreate Pokemon Mystery Dungeon in Java. 

----------


Originally put on Gitlab, but migrated to GitHub in October 2016. I have been working on this project since March 2016. **I usually update at least once per week.**

Note working does not mean working efficiently.

----------

#Currently done: 

- Can take input to move from one tile to the other. 
- State machine for handling different action states 
- Procedural Dungeon Generation (Inefficient)
- Turn-based System (Somewhat efficient)
- Pathfinding (Using inefficient djikstra's algorithm)
- Animations (Somewhat efficient)
- Sound Effects (Not many)
- Combat System (Extremely inefficient)
- System for items 
- System for retexturing tiles based on their relative positions (surprisingly easy to implement)

----------
#Planned Features
- Better turn based system
- Better pathfinding
- Better procedural dungeon generation
- Better attack system
- Better art
- Better animations
- Original characters (so I don't get sued for copyright)
- Free-movement worlds
- Storylines
- Music
- Menus and UIs that actually work
- Added flexibility and extensibility
- **Precise and extensive documentation**

#General Notes

**Most of my newest work will be on the developer branch**, so if you don't see any recent commits to the master branch, check out the developer branch. If I make large progress, I try to keep the master branch updated. 

**There is a demo availible underneath the demos folder.** Note that it might not be too polished, as I am still developing.
