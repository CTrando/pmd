# Pokemon Mystery Dungeon
To recreate Pokemon Mystery Dungeon in Java. 

----------


Originally put on Gitlab, but migrated to GitHub in October. I have been working on this project since March 2016. 

Note working does not mean working well.

----------

What I have currently done: 



- Can take input to move from one tile to the other. 
- Procedural Dungeon Generation (Inefficient)
- Turn-based System (Somewhat efficient)
- Animations (Somewhat efficient)
- Sound Effects (Not many)
- Combat System (Extremely inefficient)
- System for items
